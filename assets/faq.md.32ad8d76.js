Phishing and social engineering attacks have been successful for way too long and it&#39;s time to fix that. Web3 technology has advanced faster than Web2-based security tech\u2019s ability to adapt to it. As NFTs and crypto wallets gain popularity, a window for new, sophisticated, and malicious attacks has opened. Between 2020 and 2021 alone, cryptocurrency theft rose 516%, to $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency. In 2021, the reported median loss per hack was $1,900, according to a Federal Trade Commission report. As you can tell, we&#39;re security folks at heart, and we want that ingrained into everything! We&#39;re decentralized security, doing what Satoshi did for ledgers, for security. Decentralization is the next logical step in the equation. :::</p><h3 id="small-investors-are-afraid-of-fraud-what-can-you-tell-us-about-long-term-investment-in-your-project" tabindex="-1">Small investors are afraid of fraud.

Being that we&#39;re a security company we take auditing, both from a smart contract perspective, as well as from a security perspective, very seriously. Our smart contracts are going through rigorous auditing now and into the future using the best companies we can find.

What are the key features of your project that will benefit Interlock users?</p><p>We believe that $ILOCK token will grow in value because it&#39;s tied to tangible outcomes for our users and customers. For example, our enterprise customers will use $ILOCK to buy threat data from us\u2014and our users will be paid for generating that threat data while staying protected with our browser extension. This creates an immediate market for our token. Everyone who joins into the project early will be part of that growth journey and we want early adopters to see our ecosystem grow into more and more products that benefit individuals, enterprises, and most importantly, Web3.</p><h3 id="could-you-please-share-your-future-roadmap" tabindex="-1">Could you please share your future roadmap? <a class="header-anchor" href="#could-you-please-share-your-future-roadmap" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Here is the <a href="https://docs.interlock.network/#roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a>.

Same goes for any other identity network, like fractal, cheqd, and Soverin.</p><h3 id="where-does-this-solution-fit-in-the-big-picture" tabindex="-1">Where does this solution fit in the big picture? <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-does-this-solution-fit-in-the-big-picture" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Very simply, you install our extension, and it detects fraudulent websites as you browse in real time, while preventing you from divulging any sensitive information to said website. The extension also allows you to flag harmful websites that we miss, or unflag nonharmful websites. You can also choose to share some/all/none (the default is none) of your browsing data with us, so that we can enrich our threat-intelligence dataset. For doing these things you can receive $ILOCK Tokens, which you can exchange for other currencies at an exchange, or use them with our other products. You can also use these tokens to *stake* any grey-area-entities that we have accumulated (i.e. entities that our heuristics have not been able to categorize as a high-probability threat or non-threat) \u2014 we are letting software do what it excels at (i.e. approximate categorization at scale), and letting people do things they are good at (i.e. precise and nuanced disambiguation) via crowdsourcing.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-implement-this-trust-network" tabindex="-1">How did you implement this trust network? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-you-implement-this-trust-network" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Please see our technical <a href="https://docs.interlock.network/token/whitepaper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitepaper</a> and <a href="https://www.interlock.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a> for implementation details.</p><h3 id="what-parts-of-your-stack-are-open-source" tabindex="-1">What parts of your stack are open source? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-parts-of-your-stack-are-open-source" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The Aleph Zero blockchain that Interlock is building on is an open source project. All of our smart contracts are open source \u2014 because that is just how blockchain works, and because we would like our community to have access to these contracts for transparency. Our browser-extension is also open source. The backend parts of our stack (i.e. the data-processing pipeline and our database) are closed source, for security purposes. We <em>may</em> open source the backend components once they become more mature, or if the community expresses interest in it.</p><h3 id="are-you-a-security-company" tabindex="-1">Are you a security company? <a class="header-anchor" href="#are-you-a-security-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Interlock is not a security company \u2014 we are a Web3 focused information and data company founded by people who have years of experience in the security space. You could think of us as a <em>next generation</em> security company, or a security company for the Web3 era.</p><h3 id="what-kind-of-anonymity-do-you-offer" tabindex="-1">What kind of anonymity do you offer? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-kind-of-anonymity-do-you-offer" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The Interlock Network is built around anonymous accounts \u2014 we never require you to identify yourself with a phone number or an email address. You can have as many accounts as you want, and if <em>you</em> want to link any of those accounts to your real-world identity, that is up to you.</p><h3 id="what-interfaces-do-you-offer-for-accessing-the-network" tabindex="-1">What interfaces do you offer for accessing the network? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-interfaces-do-you-offer-for-accessing-the-network" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>We try to make the network as accessible as possible.

These two interfaces are not interchangeable and serve different purposes.</p><h3 id="how-does-the-interlock-extension-differ-from-the-interlock-web-interface" tabindex="-1">How does the Interlock Extension differ from the Interlock Web Interface? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-the-interlock-extension-differ-from-the-interlock-web-interface" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The web-interface lets you access and query the data collected from the Interlock Network \u2014 it is basically a web interface to a database. The Interlock Extension actively protects you from phishing attacks and block advertisements \u2014 you can also use it to interact with the Interlock Network.</p><h3 id="how-do-people-get-compensated-on-your-network" tabindex="-1">How do people get compensated on your network? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-people-get-compensated-on-your-network" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>People earn $ILOCK Tokens in many ways some being by using our extension passively and anonymously sharing a subset of their browsing data, or by actively flagging and staking grey-area-entities.

If the project and community get large enough, we will likely adopt a governance model akin to Rust&#39;s. We diverge from the traditional RFC process in that we (a) adopt proposals by voting via smart contract and (b) developers can show their support and affinity for each other and their ideas by using the upvote/downvote mechanism that is already in place. We do not require separate personal and developer accounts, but we also do not require the same account. Keeping with the theme of privacy and anonymity a developer can have as many accounts as they want and the project/community would have no way of knowing \u2014 which is <em>already</em> the situation in the real world (i.e. one can make as many GitHub accounts as they want). Decisions must be consensed upon \u2014 proposals require unanimous approval. Unanimous consensus is meant to eliminate the competitive nature of voting \u2014 all disagreements should be resolved at the <em>discussion</em> phase before a proposal comes to a vote. We believe that there are very few <em>true</em> and <em>unresolvable</em> contradictions in engineering. Proposals can be resubmitted for voting.</p><h3 id="this-sounds-cool" tabindex="-1">This sounds cool. <a class="header-anchor" href="#this-sounds-cool" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>I would like to be involved \u2014 are you accepting any kind of investment?</p><p>We plan on pursuing a variety of fund-raising strategies.
