Most waves of progress arose from discovering social and technological means to <em>scale up</em> trust. Everything from religion to education to banking to law to trade-unions and so on, has helped scale mutual trust between people. All of these mechanisms for promoting trust depend on centralized institutions \u2014 instead of trusting every individual, people could trust intermediaries like their bank or government. The explosive growth of the internet has also caused people to, once again, outsource their trust to central institutions. These institutions, however, exhibit many of the same flaws as their predecessors \u2014 namely, they become increasingly corrupt and increasingly exploitative, as their revenue-growth inevitably declines.</p><p>The Interlock Network leverages \u2014 among other things \u2014 the latest Blockchain Technology to achieve decentralized and resilient trust on the Web. While the early Web was the most democratic that the Web has ever been, it was quite small. However, growth exploded when Web2.0 came around, effectively democratizing and globalizing <em>participation</em> on the Web. The darkside of Web2.0 is that it sustains itself by data-mining and selling their users&#39; personal information, in addition to optimizing their feeds and search-results to keep users engaged and clicking on advertisements. This state of affairs is a clear <em>perversion</em> of the original vision, ideal, and promise of the Internet and Web. The next evolution of the Web \u2014 the blockchain-powered <strong>Web3</strong> \u2014 can correct the course and re-democratize the web without sacrificing its accessibility.</p><p>In a sentence, the Interlock technology-stack moves security to the edge of the network (i.e. the individual users) and collects anonymized data from the edge to improve the threat-detection capabilities of different parts of our stack.</p><h2 id="security" tabindex="-1">Security <a class="header-anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The mass onlining of people during the web2 era has created a target-rich environment for cyber-criminals, scammers, and high-tech-grifters. While people have to deal with online service providers and social networks \u2014 that seek to exploit their attention \u2014 they also have to deal with rapacious, anonymous online criminals \u2014 that seek to exploit their bank-accounts and credit-cards. A huge part of the problem is that the wealthiest technology companies cannot justify the costs of securing their own users, as securing them necessarily causes disruptions to their advertising-revenue stream and disruptions to their personal-data-marketplaces \u2014 which are often frequented by criminals, and nation-state-actors.</p><p>The insecurity of the internet-user \u2014 whether browsing from home, from work, or on-the-go \u2014 has reached pandemic proportions. For example, 75 percent of attacks are successful, and they have an average cost of around <strong>4 million per attack</strong>. These attackers <strong>are rapidly shifting their attention and resources to the <em>crypto currency ecosystem</em></strong>.</p><h2 id="improving-privacy-and-security-with-decentralization" tabindex="-1">Improving Privacy and Security with Decentralization <a class="header-anchor" href="#improving-privacy-and-security-with-decentralization" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There is an unintentional, but mutually-supporting, dynamic between the corporate online platforms that violate our privacy and the criminal online grifters that violate our security. Interlock believes that both privacy and security can be improved by moving <em>trust</em> away from the center of the network (i.e. Facebook, Google, etc) to the <em>edges</em> of the network (i.e. directly into people&#39;s browsers and onto the blockchain).</p><h2 id="decentralizing-security-with-the-interlock-extension" tabindex="-1">Decentralizing Security with the Interlock Extension <a class="header-anchor" href="#decentralizing-security-with-the-interlock-extension" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Security is a very difficult problem, and while much of the blame can be directed at the incentives of large tech corporations, some of it can also be directed at users feeling inconvenienced by security, for no observable benefit. Just as (almost) nobody wants to brush their teeth three times a day, nobody wants to jump through multiple security-hoops and fight with their security tools to enjoy the internet. Good and unintrusive security tools also face the <em>leaky-roof-problem</em> \u2014 just as people usually do not notice the roof on their home until it starts leaking, people do not notice security tools until they fail to prevent a breach.</p><p>Interlock takes a two-pronged approach to solving the problem \u2014 we attack the problem in the browser and on the blockchain.</p><p>We secure users&#39; browsers from phishing-attacks, credential-theft, impersonating-blockchain-sites, credit-card-phishing, credential-theft, and scam-wallets with a \u2014 uBlock-based \u2014 browser extension called Interlock. In addition to blocking ads, the extension uses an advanced visual-indicator-of-threat to detect phishing pages and scam-websites, and prevents users from entering any sensitive information like passwords or usernames. We seek to motivate users to install and use the extension by linking it to a crypto-currency token. Users earn tokens \u2014 initially \u2014 for installing the extension and browsing the web with it, and \u2014 once they have enough \u2014 they can stake grey-area-entities (i.e. pages and domains that our algorithms could not determine the trustworthiness of). This staking is essential to improving our models and heuristics, and it is an opportunity to earn a percentage return.</p><p>In case users feel that they do not have the qualifications (or the time) to analyze grey-area-entities we offer a <em>passive</em> &quot;no-brainer&quot; staking option. A user can stake in the Interlock Network. These staked tokens can in turn be used by the most successful <em>active</em> stakers, to stake grey-area entities. The <em>active</em> stakers get to take half of the yield of the tokens that were staked by <em>passive</em> stakers.</p><p>We use the Aleph Zero blockchain as a decentralized and transparent open-source mechanism to facilitate the movement of tokens and the distribution of staking-rewards.</p><p>While doing all of this, we collect all anonymized browsing data that the user has chosen to share and we use it to improve the data-sets used for threat-detection, threat-intelligence, business-analytics, and KYC. This data is then used by us and our partners (i.e. crypto-currency exchanges and other commercial entities) to improve their products and protect their customers. <h3 align="center">Token Flow</h3></p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3850344/166294045-4142af5a-3a6f-4445-a690-09c8b50970e9.png" alt="TokenFlow"></p><h3 align="center">Data Flow</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/912768323408764988/1035272326473850890/Screenshot_2022-10-27_12.21.54_PM_-_Display_2.png" alt="Data Flow"><em><h6 align="center">Click image to enlarge</h6></em></p><h3 align="center">Roadmap</h3><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95258773/233697701-a517e453-cccb-4fc6-9468-7daf3c89faa6.jpeg" alt="Interlock Timeline"><em><h6 align="center">Click image to enlarge</h6></em></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://docs.interlock.network/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> and <a href="https://docs.interlock.network/token/whitepaper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical whitepaper</a> for more details and information.</p><h2 id="emission-schedule" tabindex="-1">Emission Schedule <a class="header-anchor" href="#emission-schedule" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>In short, we plan to emit <strong>1 billion</strong> tokens, over an 86-month period.
