# ThreatSlayer is enterprise-grade security for your personal browser

ThreatSlayer is an extension for Chrome and compatible browsers (like Brave) that instantly protects you from malicious sites. Our threat-detecting AI identifies 0-day phishing sites with no setup time required. ThreatSlayer protects you as soon as you install it. Firefox version coming soon!

ThreatSlayer is a project of Interlock, a web3 company that is decentralizing security. In the future, ThreatSlayer will be powered by $ILOCK, Interlock's token launching early 2023.
