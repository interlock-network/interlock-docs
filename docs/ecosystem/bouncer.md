# Bouncer protects your Discord community from harmful URLs

Bouncer is an open-source Discord bot that scans your server for malicious links and neutralizes them. It does this by querying our database of known-malicious sites. If the site is new, we use our proprietary visual AI to identify 0-day phishing sites. Setup takes just a minute or two and it begins protecting your server instantly.
