```

You shouldn't have to worry about your tokens getting stolen or networks getting hacked. We are building out the world's first decentralized threat intelligence 
platform that strengthens the world’s ability to battle online threats. We’re creating an ecosystem of community-driven security products to protect DeFi, where 
people earn $ILOCK tokens for sharing anonymized data they control.

We are calling the space DeSec, the first of its kind decentralized security and intelligence. The first application in the ecosystem, as an example, is an anti-phishing and threat sharing platform that is a browser extension you can install and use; however, it does not yet support blockchain and token earning, that is still a work-in-progress.
