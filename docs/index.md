## What is Interlock?
Introducing Interlock, blockchain-based security products for individuals and enterprises. By leveraging blockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we harness the power of the crowd to share essential threat intelligence data between consumers and enterprises, enabling a safer internet for all.

Our AI-powered security product, ThreatSlayer, protects users from browser-based attacks and will soon reward users $ILOCK for sharing anonymized security data and submitting dangerous websites our AI misclassifies.

We monetize the shared security data in the $11 billion yearly B2B threat intel market, creating a first-of-its-kind crowdsourced threat intelligence, along with a suite of enterprise security products.
