## Introduction: Trust, Security, and Privacy
Trust is the cornerstone of prosperity and innovation &mdash; it
facilitates interaction and exchange between people. Most waves of
progress arose from discovering social and technological means to *scale
up* trust. Everything from religion to education to banking to law to
trade-unions and so on, has helped scale mutual trust between people.
All of these mechanisms for promoting trust depend on centralized
institutions &mdash; instead of trusting every individual, people could
trust intermediaries like their bank or government. The explosive growth
of the internet has also caused people to, once again, outsource their
trust to central institutions. These institutions, however, exhibit many
of the same flaws as their predecessors &mdash; namely, they become
increasingly corrupt and increasingly exploitative, as their
revenue-growth inevitably declines.

The Interlock Network leverages &mdash; among other things &mdash; the
latest Blockchain Technology to achieve decentralized and resilient
trust on the Web. While the early Web was the most democratic that the
Web has ever been, it was quite small. However, growth exploded when
Web2.0 came around, effectively democratizing and globalizing
*participation* on the Web. The darkside of Web2.0 is that it sustains
itself by data-mining and selling their users' personal information, in
addition to optimizing their feeds and search-results to keep users
engaged and clicking on advertisements. This state of affairs is a clear
*perversion* of the original vision, ideal, and promise of the Internet
and Web. The next evolution of the Web &mdash; the blockchain-powered
**web3** &mdash; can correct the course and re-democratize the web
without sacrificing its accessibility.

In a sentence, the Interlock technology-stack moves security to the edge
of the network (i.e. the individual users) and collects anonymized data
from the edge to improve the threat-detection capabilities of different
parts of our stack.

## Security
The mass onlining of people during the web2 era has created a
target-rich environment for cyber-criminals, scammers, and
high-tech-grifters. While people have to deal with online service
providers and social networks &mdash; that seek to exploit their
attention &mdash; they also have to deal with rapacious, anonymous
online criminals &mdash; that seek to exploit their bank-accounts and
credit-cards. A huge part of the problem is that the wealthiest
technology companies cannot justify the costs of securing their own
users, as securing them necessarily causes disruptions to their
advertising-revenue stream and disruptions to their
personal-data-marketplaces &mdash; which are often frequented by
criminals, and nation-state-actors.

The insecurity of the internet-user &mdash; whether browsing from home,
from work, or on-the-go &mdash; has reached pandemic proportions. For
example, 75 percent of attacks are successful, and they have an average
cost of around **4 million per attack**. These attackers **are rapidly
shifting their attention and resources to the *crypto currency
ecosystem***.

## Improving Privacy and Security with Decentralization
There is an unintentional, but mutually-supporting, dynamic between the
corporate online platforms that violate our privacy and the criminal
online grifters that violate our security. Interlock believes that both
privacy and security can be improved by moving *trust* away from the
center of the network (i.e. Facebook, Google, etc) to the *edges* of the
network (i.e. directly into people's browsers and onto the blockchain).

## Decentralizing Security with the Interlock Extension
Security is a very difficult problem, and while much of the blame can be
directed at the incentives of large tech corporations, some of it can
also be directed at users feeling inconvenienced by security, for no
observable benefit. Just as (almost) nobody wants to brush their teeth
three times a day, nobody wants to jump through multiple security-hoops
and fight with their security tools to enjoy the internet. Good and
unintrusive security tools also face the *leaky-roof-problem* &mdash;
just as people usually do not notice the roof on their home until it
starts leaking, people do not notice security tools until they fail to
prevent a breach.

Interlock takes a two-pronged approach to solving the problem &mdash; we
attack the problem in the browser and on the blockchain.

We secure users' browsers from phishing-attacks, credential-theft,
impersonating-blockchain-sites, credit-card-phishing, credential-theft,
and scam-wallets with a &mdash; uBlock-based &mdash; browser extension
called Interlock. In addition to blocking ads, the extension uses an
advanced visual-indicator-of-threat to detect phishing pages and
scam-websites, and prevents users from entering any sensitive
information like passwords or usernames. We seek to motivate users to
install and use the extension by linking it to a crypto-currency token.
Users earn tokens &mdash; initially &mdash; for installing the
extension and browsing the web with it, and &mdash; once they have
enough &mdash; they can stake grey-area-entities (i.e. pages and domains
that our algorithms could not determine the trustworthiness of). This
staking is essential to improving our models and heuristics, and it is
an opportunity to earn a percentage return.

In case users feel that they do not have the qualifications (or the time)
to analyze grey-area-entities we offer a _passive_ "no-brainer" staking option.
A user can stake in the Interlock Network. These staked tokens can in
turn be used by the most successful _active_ stakers, to stake grey-area entities.
The _active_ stakers get to take half of the yield of the tokens that were
staked by _passive_ stakers.

We use the Aleph Zero blockchain as a
decentralized and transparent open-source mechanism to facilitate the
movement of tokens and the distribution of staking-rewards.

While doing all of this, we collect all anonymized browsing data that
the user has chosen to share and we use it to improve the data-sets
used for threat-detection, threat-intelligence, business-analytics, and
KYC. This data is then used by us and our partners (i.e. crypto-currency
exchanges and other commercial entities) to improve their products and
protect their customers.

## Emission Schedule
In short, we plan to emit **1 billion** tokens, over an 86-month period.
Here are the first 3 years of emissions, divided into half-year periods.

Interlock mints a maximum of 1 billion tokens, and pledges to spend _at
 least_ 20% of revenue to buy-back tokens. Once bought, tokens may
 be burned or used to contribute to the network (i.e. by financing
 the rewards-pool for users, etc).
